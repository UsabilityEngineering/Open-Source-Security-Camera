# Open Source Security Camera

It is our belief that there are many people who would like to get a home or business security system but hesitate when looking at the price tag or begin worrying about their data security as many large companies like to record your data and sell it to other companies. When it involves footage of one's home and family, consumers are often much more hesitant. The goal of this project will allow for an easy build/setup, cheaper alternative that will keep data more secure as each user can read the source system code and evaluate the safety of the system.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Our project goal is to create a cheap alternative open source security system so a user's footage and data is not exposed or sold to others. In this gathering phase we acquired input from users on essential features and wants on this system.

We surveyed a variety of people to get a rough understanding of their intended and concerns with the security system.
* Online survey received (n=22) responses.
* 22% of responses say they do not own a security system, but would like one
* response says they own a security system and are not happy with the price

From out requirements gathering we found:
* That the principle of our project was sound and that people would be interested in a cheap and secure home security system at some point in their life even if that may not be now.
* We also found that most the features for the project that the users would like are already known by the software developers and is in the development pipeline already
