# Open Source Security Camera

It is our belief that there are many people who would like to get a home or business security system but hesitate when looking at the price tag or begin worrying about their data security as many large companies like to record your data and sell it to other companies. When it involves footage of one's home and family, consumers are often much more hesitant. The goal of this project will allow for an easy build/setup, cheaper alternative that will keep data more secure as each user can read the source system code and evaluate the safety of the system.

* **[Nicholas Hibabrd](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-nickhib/)** - with the questionnaire, wrote the personas and scenarios. met with the software team to get a better understanding of the project and what theyâ€™ve done so far. helped out with the questionnaire. Wrote some of the wireframes and higher fidelity versions. Participated in data collection and revision 
* **[John Koistinen](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-johnk-21/)** - Helped develop the questionnaire, wrote about findings from the questionnaire, and helped write about the conclusions that were drawn from the questionnaire.Wrote some of the wireframes and participated in data collection and revision 

* **[Sean O'Leary](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-seanoleary22/)** - Helped write questionnaire, wrote Caveats, studied videos for Contextual inquiry, and helped write about conclusions drawn from the questionnaire.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

Our project goal is to create a **cheap alternative open source security system** so a user's footage and **data is not exposed** or sold to others. In this gathering phase we acquired input from users on **essential features** and wants on this system.

We surveyed a **gropup of people** to get a rough understanding of their intended and concerns with the security system.
* Online survey received **(n=22) responses**.
* **22%** of responses say they **do not own a security system, but would like one**
* **a response** who does have one says they own a security system and are **not happy with the price**

From out requirements gathering we found:
* That the principle of our project was sound and that people would be **interested in a cheap and secure home security system** at some point in their life even if that may not be now.
* We also found that most **requested features** for the project that the users would like are **already known** by the software developers and is **in the development pipeline already**.

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

**Executive Summary**

The goal of this phase is to design the interface of the product. This will bring to light potential faults the interface will have, it will also give an example of what the end product will look like for the users. 

We Create a wireframe of the program, so there is an idea of what the program will look like when done.
* Designed a Homepage 
* Designed a Cameras page
* Designed a Notification page
* Designed a Recordings page
* Designed a Extras page


The creation of a wire frame is significant because it provides for a better understanding of the user experience.
* Creates a better Grasp of what the users **experience** will be like, through **testing**.
* Gives an idea of what the **program/website** will look like.
* Lessens **work** for the developers.
* Will hasten the process of developing.
* will create less **errors** for the final product. 
* creates a **better** end product.

# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

**Executive Summary**

In order to verify our prototype's design we created a protocol for a usability test that we carried out with other students. This protocol had the participants run through a number of tasks where the participant had to navigate through the user interface. While they were completing the tasks we asked them to think aloud so we could better understand the thought process someone goes through while attempting to navigate.

* Created informed consent document which participants agree to before usability test
* Designed protocol for conducting usability test 
* Conducted usability test with multiple participants
* Took notes and organized data for analyzing

The data that we gathered from the usability test will help us understand the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype.

* Understand what went right in our prototype
* Understand where we went wrong and how it can be improved
* See if there are any additional features users would like
* Find out if there are any unwanted or not needed features in the current design
