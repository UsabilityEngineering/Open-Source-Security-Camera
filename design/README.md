# Interaction Design

# Sign in Page

Our team decided to design a sign-in page for those that wish to access their account away from their home computer, for example when a client has their system set up but they wish to view their home feed from any device. They would need to log in to their account online to do it. This is assuming they have allowed their account to be online. 


# Duo Authentication

The team's has decided to make a duo authentication function to the website so if one is on the go they can have a bit more security to their account. This is for the users that are a bit more fearful of their account information being linked or maybe their footage being stolen.


# Home Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175279-a26a0b67-b7e6-42a6-8181-ce5c286256fc.png)



This is the home page of the website or program. Our team went with this design because it seems the most fluid and simple design we could think of. The user will be able to easily access all the required features of the app or website. It will display your main camera which one can select within the app.


# Cameras Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175334-043ec058-2dd5-487f-bb7f-59aac813b202.png)


When one goes to the home page they will have the option to go to cameras and when the user clicks the cameras a view of all his cameras will appear. One will be able to view all their cameras from here. 


# Notifications Page

Next, we have the notification page. The notification page will record specific instances when something of note has happened in the area of the camera. One may use the front door notification the most due to mailmen and others going to your door. The user will receive a notification of the specific event and will be able to see a small snippet of what has happened within the motion picture. Our team felt like this design would be very nice for the user experience because one will beagle to see all the notifications at will and select those of note with ease. 


# Recordings Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175409-f4b68ac6-ab8f-4f55-a242-abc624fe0ba8.png)


The recordings page will store all the recordings of notes for the user to access at their will. We decided to sort the recordings by the cameras that she or he has added to the system and it gives that kind of Netflix scroller feel. One will be able to scroll to the right depending on the number of cameras they have per area. It would more likely be maybe at most 3 cameras per room or area. The recordings will be sorted by the most recent recordings, left to right. Our team thinks this is the most fluid way to do this because there are many websites with this same feature for videos and the user may be already acquainted with this design.


# Extras Page

This page is for any extra features we can come up with for the user to use. This page will be further edited in the future because the team feels that there is plenty of extra functionality that can be added to this page. Currently, it only does a few tasks but this can have more options especially if the user wishes to mode the code they may be able to add it to their specific local launcher here. 


# Settings Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175552-96c38748-f75e-4a2d-91f1-17aef4991c6b.png)



This is the settings page this will have all the profile-specific settings such as customization. For example, if one wants to have the page black instead of white for easier viewing on the eyes. They can also have the option to turn on notifications and this will allow their system to show notifications on your windows os, or if one wants they can have it sent to their phone once they add a phone number to their profile. These is just several settings the user can check on and off. Our team will continue to talk to the software engineering team for ideas of what setting our team can add in the future as well, but with the scope of this project it might be pretty basic towards the end 


# Prifile Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175601-bd47d895-381e-44ea-a48e-41fd3ca041f9.png)



This page is the profile our team decided that this page would just have the basic profile information. This is because there isnt mush one can add to the profile for this product. Our team have spread everything out into many pages but the profile will be where you can set your phone number and passcode for the duo authentication.


# Create Account Page


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98436821/166175626-77ac155b-a595-4679-8993-8e1e7d7a700b.png)



This page is a typical account creation page we feel that it would be useful for users to have an account.This is so they can customize their account.it will allow the user the option for notifications and other features of the app.


# Account Athentication

If the user has forgoten their password they will have an chance to identify themselves and change their password through this page.
# Changing Password

The user will replace their old password with a new one if they need to, after clearing the authentication page.
