## Findings from heuristic evaluations/ cognitive walkthroughs

During our heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough we received consistently positive feedback on our prototype coming to the general consensus that it was very clean and utilitarian in nature. The only constructive feedback we had involved proper labeling of page categories as they seemed either vague or redundant as well as the location of some of the features such as camera addition and cloud storage under the extras tab being a bit difficult to find so they would likely be moved or have the tab renamed.


## Protocol

[Protocol PDF](/protocol.pdf) 

For the protocol we designed three tasks which we thought were good to get a gauge on how usable our prototype currently is. 

### Task 1

In this task we suppose the situation where a participant has just connected a new camera, and now has to link it with the app to access its feed. We state that the user has already set up the camera's hardware and now has to add it to the website. As our “Add Camera” button isn’t immediately available on the home screen we hoped to see where the users' minds would jump first when trying to find a feature. Going in we also had a suspicion that the “Add Camera” button was challenging to find, with this task we wanted to prove or disprove this theory. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.


### Task 2

A primary purpose of a security camera is to keep your home safe by being a constant eye even while you may be away on travel or vacation. For this task we explained a situation where the user is out of town and a neighbor mentions that someone was snooping around in the backyard a few days earlier on 03/22/2022. After, we asked the participant to try and find a recording from their back porch security camera taken on that date. Our goal for this task was to see how easy or hard it was to navigate to the recordings and the recordings themselves. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.

### Task 3

Another feature of security cameras is that you don’t have to physically look outside to see what is going on outside of your home because of the live feed displayed on the website. In this task we inform the participant that someone is at their front door and they would like to know who it is. We then ask how they would go about finding out who is at the door. Our goal was to see if our cameras section would be understood to be a “live feed” of multiple cameras at first glance. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.

### Wrap-up


After all of the tasks had been completed we conducted a simple Wrap-up where we asked general questions about the participants' experience using the prototype and if they had anything they would like to add. 


## Study Approach

Our approach to the study was primarily a formative evaluation. Because not all of our participants had experience using a competitor home security system before, we thought it would be best to focus on what worked best in our current design and what didn’t. Our main concern was figuring out what didn’t work to our expectations. Because we had designed the prototype, navigating the UI came easy. We needed fresh eyes who had never seen it before to determine if our UI was actually as usable as we had hoped. In order to gain the most information possible we urged the participants to think aloud during the test to understand what they were thinking and what their decision process looked like. 


## Interpretation

(interpretation of mock data as if it were real)

We were very pleased with our data gathered from the usability tests as all users found the style of the prototype and the layout to be fairly concise and easy to use. That being said, we received very consistent constructive feedback from users that aligned with our understanding of issues in the design of our site that we had already been made aware of but wanted to validate. As such we feel comfortable implementing a couple changes to the design. 

The first point of feedback of which was involving task 1 where we found that most users when attempting to add a camera would first go to the camera page to do so looking for the option there, then to settings, and then to extras where the setting actually was. So based on this we decided that it would likely be best to add the option to add a camera to that cameras page.

The second point of feedback was involving the overall design mainly in the naming of the extras tab as there seemed to be more device related settings compared to extras which the users found to be a bit vague. The fix to this proposed by the users was to rename it as “device settings” which the users received much better.

Another notable point received from a couple users was the layout of the home page seemed a bit redundant. The users mentioned that it would be nice for the cameras page to be the home page instead and to have the cameras open up to the size of the home page window when the individual cameras are clicked. Although this setting mostly applies to a user that would have more than one camera as the users with one camera would only have one option and it would be easier to leave in the current implementation. So we are considering adding the option to do both.
