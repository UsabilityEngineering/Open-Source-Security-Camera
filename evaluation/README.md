## Protocol

[Protocol PDF](/protocol.pdf) 


### Task 1

In this task we suppose the situation where a participant has just connected a new camera, and now has to link it with the app to access its feed. We state that the user has already set up the camera's hardware and now has to add it to the website. As our “Add Camera” button isn’t immediately available on the home screen we hoped to see where the users' minds would jump first when trying to find a feature. Going in we also had a suspicion that the “Add Camera” button was challenging to find, with this task we wanted to prove or disprove this theory. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.


### Task 2

A primary purpose of a security camera is to keep your home safe by being a constant eye even while you may be away on travel or vacation. For this task we explained a situation where the user is out of town and a neighbor mentions that someone was snooping around in the backyard a few days earlier on 03/22/2022. After, we asked the participant to try and find a recording from their back porch security camera taken on that date. Our goal for this task was to see how easy or hard it was to navigate to the recordings and the recordings themselves. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.

### Task 3

Another feature of security cameras is that you don’t have to physically look outside to see what is going on outside of your home because of the live feed displayed on the website. In this task we inform the participant that someone is at their front door and they would like to know who it is. We then ask how they would go about finding out who is at the door. Our goal was to see if our cameras section would be understood to be a “live feed” of multiple cameras at first glance. Assuming the user had completed the task we asked them to rate the difficulty of completing it on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very difficult” and 5 is “Very easy”.

### Wrap-up


After all of the tasks had been completed we conducted a simple Wrap-up where we asked general questions about the participants' experience using the prototype and if they had anything they would like to add. 


## Study Approach

Our approach to the study was primarily a formative evaluation. Because not all of our participants had experience using a competitor home security system before, we thought it would be best to focus on what worked best in our current design and what didn’t. Our main concern was figuring out what didn’t work to our expectations. Because we had designed the prototype, navigating the UI came easy. We needed fresh eyes who had never seen it before to determine if our UI was actually as usable as we had hoped. In order to gain the most information possible we urged the participants to think aloud during the test to understand what they were thinking and what their decision process looked like.
