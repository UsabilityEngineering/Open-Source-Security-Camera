## Methods

# Questionnaire & Contextual Inquiry**

We decided to use these instruments because the form made for an easy medium for distribution and data collection, and we believed that the contextual inquiry would be useful to see how a user would interact with a current competitor and how that benefitted or retracted from their experience

**Response rates**

<ul>
  <li>Questionnaire n=22</li>
  <li>Contextual Inquiry n=0 (we are still working on sourcing somebody or some way to perform the inquiry on a competing system but it has proven difficult as its expensive and security based so it is difficult to find somebody who has one, or somebody who is comfortable sharing their experience.</li>
</ul>

**Findings**

*Questionnaire*

<ul>
  <li>All of of our responses are from people with similar backgrounds to us this misrepresents our user base, because people who do not know a lot about computers might not know/care about data privacy</li>
