# Requirements Gathering

## Methods

### Questionnaire & Contextual Inquiry

We decided to use these instruments because the form made for an easy medium for distribution and data collection, and we believed that the contextual inquiry would be useful to see how a user would interact with a current competitor and how that benefitted or retracted from their experience

  **Response rates**

<ul>
  <li>Questionnaire n=22</li>
  <li>Contextual Inquiry n=0 (we are still working on sourcing somebody or some way to perform the inquiry on a competing system but it has proven difficult as its expensive and security based so it is difficult to find somebody who has one, or somebody who is comfortable sharing their experience.</li>
</ul>

## Findings

  **Questionnaire**

<ul>
  <li>All of of our responses are from people with similar backgrounds to us this misrepresents our user base, because people who do not know a lot about computers might not know/care about data privacy</li>
  <li>Almost all of the responses (19/22) say data privacy is very important
</li>
  <li>A lot of our responses (17/22)  say they do not trust large companies with their data. This is important as the other two biggest providers of home security systems are from large corporations with suspect data privacy backgrounds (ring and google home)
</li>
  <li>Only 3 of our responses say they are not familiar with the concept of open source. This proves out suspicion that our responses are misrepresenting our user base as the average person will most likely not know about open source software
</li>
  <li>Half of our responses indicate that the code being open source would make them uncomfortable. This is surprising to us as it is our belief that open source makes software more secure if handled properly. This could be an issue because one of our projects' big goals is to make sure the software is open source. 
</li>
  <li>13 of our responses are interested in a privacy minded home security solution. Of those that aren’t interested, most don’t seem to want anysort of camera around their house, or they don’t think they have a need for a system. 
</li>
  <li>In the free response portion of the questionnaire most users requested a motion detecting feature that would alert them when motion is detected on one of the cameras. This is definitely an important feature, but it may be hard to implement. This is also a feature that is offered by almost all of the big home security providers.
</li>
  <li>Nearly every response said they prefer a mobile app to view their security system versus a web app (18/22). If the software team is comfortable with it, they should focus on a mobile app. This is also something that is offered by competitors
</li>
  <li>17 (77%) of the responses indicated that if they were to own a business they would be interested in our product. This is telling and we should try and collect some information from business owners. 
</li>
</ul>
  
  **Contextual Inquiry**
<ul>
 <li>We did not get any of the volunteers for our contextual inquiry to share their security systems experience with us as most of the people we interviewed either did not have one to share with us or felt uncomfortable sharing their security system with us in some form which is perfectly understandable. We resorted mostly to youtube videos of people performing unboxings and setups of competing systems. During which we found that they were not difficult to set up in the case of the Ring doorbell and google nest and that the UI often was a simple UI with all the simple functionality of a general security system close at hand with some of the the more advanced features obstructed.</li>
</ul>

## Conclusions

<ul>
  <li>Overall, our responses cared about data privacy and security, but were more weary of open source software. While the big corporations offer the features the user wants, a mobile application with motion detection, no one can be 100% sure what they are doing with the users data. The users data is an important feature shown by our survey so our product definitely has a spot in the market.</li>
  <li>Because in our questionnaire we found that users care a lot about motion detection, it should be a focus for our development team </li>
  <li>In our questionnaire we found that potential users are weary of open source, it may be worth discussing whether or not we should promote the open sourceness of our project as much as the other features </li>
</ul>

## Conclusions

<ul>
  <li>Due to the small number of participants and limited reach of the survey, we have a very niche demographic currently being the only one surveyed. That demographic being the younger, technology savvy, computer science students in our course that will know more about software and data security.</li>
  <li>Because we haven’t found anyone to do a contextual inquiry with, we are currently limited to the data from our survey. While this information is useful to get a picture of the interest, it does not provide what a contextual inquiry would. </li>
</ul>
