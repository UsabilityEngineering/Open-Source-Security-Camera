## Methods

### Questionnaire & Contextual Inquiry

We decided to use these instruments because the form made for an easy medium for distribution and data collection, and we believed that the contextual inquiry would be useful to see how a user would interact with a current competitor and how that benefitted or retracted from their experience

**Response rates**

<ul>
  <li>Questionnaire n=22</li>
  <li>Contextual Inquiry n=0 (we are still working on sourcing somebody or some way to perform the inquiry on a competing system but it has proven difficult as its expensive and security based so it is difficult to find somebody who has one, or somebody who is comfortable sharing their experience.</li>
</ul>

### Findings

**Questionnaire**

<ul>
  <li>All of of our responses are from people with similar backgrounds to us this misrepresents our user base, because people who do not know a lot about computers might not know/care about data privacy</li>
  <li>Almost all of the responses (19/22) say data privacy is very important
</li>
  <li>A lot of our responses (17/22)  say they do not trust large companies with their data. This is important as the other two biggest providers of home security systems are from large corporations with suspect data privacy backgrounds (ring and google home)
</li>
  <li>Only 3 of our responses say they are not familiar with the concept of open source. This proves out suspicion that our responses are misrepresenting our user base as the average person will most likely not know about open source software
</li>
  <li>Half of our responses indicate that the code being open source would make them uncomfortable. This is surprising to us as it is our belief that open source makes software more secure if handled properly. This could be an issue because one of our projects' big goals is to make sure the software is open source. 
</li>
  <li>13 of our responses are interested in a privacy minded home security solution. Of those that aren’t interested, most don’t seem to want anysort of camera around their house, or they don’t think they have a need for a system. 
</li>
  <li>In the free response portion of the questionnaire most users requested a motion detecting feature that would alert them when motion is detected on one of the cameras. This is definitely an important feature, but it may be hard to implement. This is also a feature that is offered by almost all of the big home security providers.
</li>
  <li>Nearly every response said they prefer a mobile app to view their security system versus a web app (18/22). If the software team is comfortable with it, they should focus on a mobile app. This is also something that is offered by competitors
</li>
  <li>17 (77%) of the responses indicated that if they were to own a business they would be interested in our product. This is telling and we should try and collect some information from business owners. 
</li>
</ul>
